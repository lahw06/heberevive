                <h2>Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii)</h2>
                <p><strong>What it is:</strong><br><span class="filler">Shea butter is a thick, natural fat extracted from the nuts of a shea tree.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Where it comes from:</strong><br><span class="filler">Shea trees are primarily grown in the Shea Belt, a region stretching across West Africa, including countries like Ghana, Nigeria, and Burkina Faso. The shea butter we use for our products comes specifically from Ghana.</span></p>
                <p><strong>How it's produced:</strong><br><span class="filler">Shea butter is traditionally produced in a hands-on process by local communities. The nuts are boiled to soften the shells, which are then hand-extracted. The discarded shells are repurposed as cooking fuel, while the seeds are cracked and roasted. The roasted seeds are beaten with water to release their rich fats, which are boiled, skimmed, and cooled to create the shea butter we use today.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Sustainability:</strong><br><span class="filler">Shea butter is a highly sustainable resource, often growing in the wild without the need for intensive farming. Its production is known as “women’s gold,” providing significant economic opportunities for women in West Africa, particularly in Ghana. These women hand-harvest and process the shea nuts, supporting local economies through small-scale businesses. Shea trees can live for up to 300 years, acting as effective carbon sinks and contributing to environmental sustainability.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Cruelty-Free:</strong><br><span class="filler">Shea butter is cruelty-free, produced without animal testing or exploitation. It’s ethically harvested and processed by local communities using traditional, environmentally-friendly methods.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Benefits for the skin:</strong><br><span class="filler">Shea butter is rich in essential fatty acids, like linoleic and oleic acids, which balance skin oils and prevent acne. Its anti-inflammatory properties help soothe psoriasis, eczema, and sunburn, while also relieving muscle soreness. Packed with vitamins A, E, and F, shea butter promotes collagen production for anti-aging and aids in skin regeneration. It also locks in moisture, strengthens the skin’s barrier, and provides mild sun protection (SPF 3-4) without feeling greasy.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Historical use:</strong><br><span class="filler">Shea butter has been used for millennia, notably in ancient Egypt under Cleopatra, where it was prized for protecting skin and hair from the harsh sun. In traditional African medicine, it was also used to treat joint pain and arthritis, emphasizing its long-standing role in both beauty and healing practices.</span></p>

                <p><strong>Sustainability:</strong><br><span class="filler">Collagen production promotes sustainability by converting animal byproducts into valuable resources, thereby minimizing waste and supporting eco-friendly practices.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Cruelty-Free:</strong><br><span class="filler">The collagen is sourced from local, free-range animals in the UK, raised to the highest welfare standards, certified by Red Tractor, and regularly monitored and audited for continuous improvement, ensuring a cruelty-free production process.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Benefits for the skin:</strong><br><span class="filler">Hydrolyzed collagen provides numerous skin benefits, functioning as a natural antioxidant that combats oxidative stress and mitigates the effects of aging, such as dryness, laxity, and wrinkles. Its low molecular weight peptides enhance skin moisture by penetrating the stratum corneum, the uppermost layer of the epidermis (the superficial layer of the skin), leading to improved hydration levels and increased skin surface lipids. Studies have demonstrated significant enhancements in hydration, smoothness, luminosity, and microtexture within four weeks of use while also reducing transepidermal water loss. Composed primarily of amino acids like glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline, hydrolyzed collagen supports skin structure and promotes overall skin health and vitality.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Historical use:</strong><br><span class="filler">Products containing collagen were used in medicine and beauty treatments in ancient Egypt and China, but it wasn't officially isolated and utilized until the 20th century.</span></p>

                <h2>Water (Aqua)</h2>
                <p><strong>What it is:</strong><br><span class="filler">In the skin, water serves as a vital component that maintains hydration, supports elasticity, and helps regulate temperature. It is primarily found in the epidermis, where it contributes to the skin's barrier function and overall appearance, playing a crucial role in preventing dryness and maintaining a healthy complexion.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Where it comes from:</strong><br><span class="filler">We use water sourced from pristine mountain springs to ensure purity and quality in our formulations.</span></p>
                <p><strong>How it's produced:</strong><br><span class="filler">It is produced naturally by Mother Nature through the hydrological cycle, or if you go in deeper, by one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms joined by covalent bonds and the molecules are held together by hydrogen bonding.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Sustainability:</strong><br><span class="filler">Water is so abundant on Earth so very sustainable.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Cruelty-Free:</strong><br><span class="filler">Water is cruelty-free, as it doesn’t require animal testing and is a natural resource essential for all living beings.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Benefits for the skin:</strong><br><span class="filler">Water is essential to the skin because most cells are made up of about 70% water, which is crucial for maintaining cellular function and integrity. In hand creams, water acts as a solvent that evenly distributes active ingredients, boosting their effectiveness. Furthermore, it helps create a moisturizing layer that reduces transepidermal water loss, keeping the skin hydrated and healthy.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Historical use:</strong><br><span class="filler">Water is a vital source of life for all creatures, serving as the foundation for survival and growth throughout the history of the Earth.</span></p>

                <h2>Sea Salt</h2>
                <p><strong>What it is:</strong><br><span class="filler">Sea salt is a natural mineral obtained by evaporating seawater.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Where it comes from:</strong><br><span class="filler">Sea salt is harvested from ocean water, sourced from the surrounding seas and produced by a local UK company, capturing the essence of the British coastline.</span></p>
                <p><strong>How it's produced:</strong><br><span class="filler">Sea salt is produced by evaporating seawater through natural processes like solar evaporation or boiling, allowing the salt to crystallize and be harvested.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Sustainability:</strong><br><span class="filler">Sea salt production is sustainable as it relies on a renewable resource—seawater—and often utilizes eco-friendly methods that minimize environmental impact.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Cruelty-Free:</strong><br><span class="filler">Sea salt is cruelty-free, as its production involves no harm to animals and is derived entirely from natural marine sources.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Benefits for the skin:</strong><br><span class="filler">Salt is naturally coarse, making it an effective exfoliant that removes dead skin cells and boosts blood flow, promoting healthy skin growth. This benefit extends to nails as well, providing a smooth surface for nail polish without the need for harsh filing, which can lead to breaks over time. By applying some pressure during exfoliation, salt stimulates stronger nail growth to counteract the applied force, encouraging resilience and durability.</span></p>
                <p><strong>Historical use:</strong><br><span class="filler">Historically, salt has been utilized in skincare for its exfoliating properties, as well as its ability to cleanse and purify the skin, making it a popular ingredient in ancient beauty rituals.</span></p>
