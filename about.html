                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>
                        At Hebe Revive, we're dedicated to offering high-quality skincare that's 100% natural. Frustrated with the beauty industry being dominated by synthetic chemicals, lies, and unrealistic standards? So are we. That's why we started this company—to create skincare products you actually need and also kind to our planet.
                    </p>
                   <p>There are too many products these days offering fancy serums with newly discovered chemicals aimed at solving problems that don't even exist. These issues were invented to make you feel inadequate and spend excessive amounts of money to fix them. For instance, cellulite wasn't considered a problem; most women had it after puberty, and it only became an issue due to media influence. We don't do that here, no inventing new problems, life does enough of that already.</p>
                    <p>
                        Now, look at our products. We use 100% natural ingredients that have been utilized by women for millennia—from olive oil in ancient Athens, shea butter in ancient Egypt, to sweet almond oil in ancient China. Timeless natural products that never go out of trend, and you know why? Because they work to fix problems we actually have.

                    <h2>Our Founder</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hi! I'm the founder of Hebe Revive. I spent five years studying veterinary medicine and countless hours scrubbing my hands raw for sterility. This experience, along with intense research into the human integument—or skin—led me to create a hand cream that hydrates without drying out your skin.
                    </p>
                    <p>My background in veterinary medicine has provided me with a deep understanding of skin health and the importance of using gentle, effective ingredients. Driven by a passion for natural skincare, I am committed to developing high-quality products that prioritize both your well-being and the health of our planet.</p>
                    <p>
                    Besides veterinary, I am also a ballroom and Latin dancer, I value reliable beauty products that keep up with an active lifestyle. Creating natural alternatives that work better was a game changer for me, and I'm excited to expand our range of products. Stay tuned—more amazing products are on the way!

                    <h2>Hebe (Goddess of Eternal Youth)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our name is inspired by Hebe, the ancient Greek goddess of eternal youth. The daughter of Zeus and Hera, and wife to the hero Heracles; Hebe was celebrated for her role in serving ambrosia to the gods, a symbol of vitality and rejuvenation in Greek mythology. Her connection to these divine qualities of renewal and energy makes her a timeless symbol of youth.
                    </p>
                    <p>Hebe’s legacy as a symbol of youthfulness is deeply rooted in ancient wisdom, which we embrace in our approach to skincare. Her spirit of revitalization inspires us to develop products that naturally restore and enhance the skin’s vitality. We draw upon the power of nature’s finest ingredients, using formulations that reflect a commitment to natural beauty and rejuvenation.</p>
                    <p>
                        Just as Hebe brought renewal and eternal youth to the gods, we aim to bring the same sense of freshness and vigor to your skincare routine. Our focus is on reviving your skin’s natural glow with sustainable, nature-inspired ingredients, ensuring that beauty is both timeless and earth-conscious.
