                    <p>
                        For optimal hydration, apply a small amount to clean, dry hands and massage it in until fully absorbed. Take special care over drier areas like knuckles, and rub the cream into your cuticles and nail beds. Use it first thing in the morning, right before bed, after showering or washing hands, and then as needed throughout the day. You may find that you need to use it more frequently during the winter months, as colder weather can be more drying to the skin.

                        Yes, all Hebe Revive products are formulated with gentle, natural ingredients, making them suitable for sensitive skin. We’ve thoroughly researched each ingredient to ensure its safety and effectiveness, with many of our ingredients being used as natural remedies for thousands of years. However, we always recommend reviewing the ingredient list and performing a patch test before full use.

                    <p>
                        We ethically source our ingredients from trusted, reliable suppliers, prioritizing local communities where possible. We fully vet our sources to ensure that no ingredient is involved in animal testing or cruelty. Each ingredient is chosen for its purity, sustainability, and effectiveness.

                    <p>
                        Typically, our products have a shelf life of 12 months once opened. However, for optimal results, we recommend using them within the first 3 months to benefit from the freshest ingredients. Since our products are all-natural, you may notice light separation after this - it is completely normal and safe to use. It's simply the oils and water moving apart, which may make the product feel slightly more oily. A good shake will usually bring the formula back together, and we're actively working on improving this.

                        Before using a new product, apply a small amount to a discreet area of skin, such as the inside of your elbow or wrist. Wait 24-48 hours to check for any redness, irritation, or reactions before using the product regularly.

                        Our testers with skin conditions have only reported positive results. As the founder, I personally have psoriasis, and the hand cream has helped with some of my flare-ups. We still recommend performing a patch test to ensure the product works well with your skin.

                        We use natural preservatives to ensure our products stay fresh without compromising their purity. You'll never find synthetic preservatives like parabens in any of our formulations.

                    <p>
                        To ensure your products stay fresh and effective, store them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Heat can encourage separation of the natural ingredients, so keeping them away from warm temperatures, like radiators or space heaters, will help preserve the formula and maintain its consistency.

                        Artificial scents, which are often alcohol-based, can dry out the skin, which is why we don’t use any synthetic fragrances in our products. Some of the natural ingredients we use may have their own subtle aromas that come directly from nature. While we’re considering adding essential oils in the future with guidance from experts, we’d love to hear your thoughts.
